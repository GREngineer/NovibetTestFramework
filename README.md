# NovibetTestFramework

//    I managed to reach up to this part of the exercise. For the next tasks, I can imagine I would need to find
//    the xpath for the scheduled matches page that points to the schedule table, copy and store only 4 of
//    the values (home team + dash + away team + start time) in a list. Then make a second list for the matches in the
//    Live Page and create an if/else loop that compares them; this is however far beyond my coding skill at the moment.
//    Regarding calls to the website, I would use Jenkins to deploy the code every five minutes, but I wasn't able to
//    complete that within the timeframe. Thanks for taking the time to read a  ͟v͟e͟r͟y͟ junior's work! ( :
